# **Amatl – Handmade Paper Studio Website**
*Built with Nuxt 4, Tailwind CSS, and Bun*

---

## **Overview**
**Amatl** is a boutique handmade paper studio with locations in **Los Angeles, California** and **San Miguel de Allende, Mexico**. The studio specializes in creating artisanal, plant-based papers crafted from **native fibers unique to each region**. Seasonal, cultural, and botanical elements—such as flowers, seeds, grasses, and natural dyes—are incorporated into each sheet to celebrate ecological diversity and traditional papermaking practices.

This website serves as the digital home for Amatl’s products, workshops, and studio narrative. It showcases the artistry behind handmade paper, highlights the studio’s regional focus, and provides a seamless experience for browsing collections, learning about techniques, and connecting with the studio.
